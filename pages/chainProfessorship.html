        <p>
          To foster research and innovation in emerging fields that benefit
          society, the University plans to establish several prestigious chair
          positions with financial and technical support from various sponsors,
          such as industry partners (both public and private sector), alumni,
          and other individuals or institutions. The University aims to attract
          distinguished academics and industry experts from around the world to
          these chair positions and enable them to pursue their research and
          other activities in line with the objectives of the chair. This
          initiative is not only a part of the University's faculty recruitment
          and development efforts, but also a recognition of the excellence and
          honour of the appointees. To ensure the sustainability and smooth
          operation of this initiative, the University has devised some
          procedural guidelines to manage this initiative.
