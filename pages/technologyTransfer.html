        <br />
        <!-- Heading 5 -->
        <h3>5. Ensuring Fair Opportunity for Technology Transfer</h3>
        <p>
          DTU is committed to providing an equitable opportunity for all
          companies, individuals, and potential licensees to explore and engage
          in licensing opportunities for technologies developed through DTU's

          openness throughout the entire process, including the call for
          applications, the shortlisting of applicants, and the selection of
          companies for technology transfer. To achieve this, DTU will:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Disseminate detailed information about the technologies available

            approach ensures a broad outreach, encouraging diverse stakeholders
            to participate in the technology transfer process and fostering a
            transparent and inclusive environment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <!-- Heading 6 -->
        <h3>6. Relevant Agreements in the Technology Transfer Process</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the technology transfer process, various agreements play a
          crucial role in facilitating a smooth and transparent exchange. Prior
          to divulging any confidential information, an initial step involves
          entering into a <strong> Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</strong> with
          the potential licensee. This agreement ensures the safeguarding of
          confidential information related to the technology, allowing the
          potential licensee to conduct due diligence. Another essential
          agreement in the process is the
          <strong> Material Transfer Agreement (MTA)</strong>. Under the MTA,
          the laboratory or institute can transfer pertinent materials,
          including molecules, protocols, reagents, antibodies, etc. These
          transferred materials often play a pivotal role in the development and
          commercialization of the technology. For the actual transfer of
          technology, a <strong> License Agreement (LA)</strong> is executed
          between DTU and the licensee, facilitating the formal transfer of the
          technology. This agreement outlines the terms and conditions governing
          the utilization of the technology. To initiate discussions regarding
          the transfer of materials and/or technology, a
          <strong> Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</strong> is established.
          This agreement serves as a foundational document for outlining the
          framework and intentions of the parties involved in the transfer
          process. The details of the Legal Agreements to be entered are as
          follows: -
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong> Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA):</strong> Before deciding on
            technology licensing from DTU, prospective licensees may seek to
            conduct due diligence for a comprehensive understanding of the
            technology. To safeguard DTU's intellectual property, it is
            imperative to enter into an NDA with the prospective licensee. This
            agreement serves as a prerequisite, allowing the prospective
            licensee to carry out due diligence to validate claims about the
            technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Material Transfer Agreement (MTA):</strong> DTU engages in
            the transfer of materials, such as molecules, protocols, reagents,
            antibodies, to various government and private
            institutes/organizations for research and development purposes.
            Prospective licensees may also express interest in obtaining samples
            of the product/technology developed for due diligence. In such
            cases, a Material Transfer Agreement is essential, serving as a
            prerequisite for providing materials for research, development, and
            due diligence while safeguarding DTU's intellectual property.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Licensing Agreement (LA) for Transfer of Technology:
            </strong>
            DTU engages in the transfer of materials, such as molecules,
            protocols, reagents, antibodies, to various government and private
            institutes/organizations for research and development purposes.
            Prospective licensees may also express interest in obtaining samples
            of the product/technology developed for due diligence. In such
            cases, a Material Transfer Agreement is essential, serving as a
            prerequisite for providing materials for research, development, and
            due diligence while safeguarding DTU's intellectual property.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU): </strong>At the initial
            stages of negotiations for the transfer of materials and/or
            technologies, it is sometimes necessary to execute a Memorandum of
            Understanding (MoU). This serves as a starting point, defining the
            scope and purpose of the collaboration. The understanding
            established through the MoU is then implemented through a detailed
            agreement, specifying specific terms and conditions.

        <!-- Heading 7 -->
        <h3>7. Handholding Support by DTU</h3>
        <p>
          DTU Faculty/Scientists will provide handholding support to ensure the
          successful transfer of technology, including know-how, to the licensee
          for further development and commercialization. If travel by DTU
          scientists is required to facilitate technology transfer and provide
          handholding support, the associated expenses, including boarding and
          lodging charges for both DTU and non-DTU staff, will be born by the
          licensee as per actuals and government rules.
        </p>

          including relevant details, drawings, product information, essential
          process details, process parameters, and packaging/handling
          information, will be provided to the licensee.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- Heading 9 -->
        <h3>9. Technology Transfer Fees and Royalty Sharing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong> Technology Transfer Fees: </strong> For the licensing of
            technologies, an upfront payment will be applicable, determined on a
            case-by-case basis through technology valuation. The upfront payment
            can be made either as a one-time payment based on the Technology
            Readiness Level (TRL) of the licensed technology or as staggered
            payments linked to the achievement of specific milestones.

            <strong> Royalty from Net Sales:</strong> Grantees/Licensees of DTU
            involved in the commercialization of DTU technologies are required
            to make royalty payments from 'Net Sales.' The term 'Net Sales'
            refers to the gross sales conducted by the company, its licensee, or
            its sub-licensee, based on the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the
            product. This excludes applicable excise duty, Goods and Services
            Tax (GST), or any other levies, as defined by the Indian Accounting
            Standards and certified by a Chartered Accountant. Royalty payments
            are to be calculated as a percentage of the net sales, ensuring a
            fair and transparent mechanism for revenue sharing in the
            commercialization process.

            <strong> Variation in Technology Transfer and Royalty Fees: </strong
            >There could be variations in Technology Transfer Fees and Royalty
            Fees structure for the same technology when non-exclusive licenses
            are considered at different points in time. These variations could
            be attributed to the following reasons:
            <ul>
              <li>Licensing Regions</li>
              <li>Mode of Technology Transfer</li>
              <li>Size of the companies/Technology Transfer seekers</li>

        <h3>10. Sharing of Revenue Between DTU and Inventor(S)</h3>
        <p>
          The protection of IP serves, among other purposes, as an incentive for
          individuals associated with DTU, encouraging research endeavours that
          lead to marketable products or processes, ultimately generating
          revenue for DTU. As a guiding principle, DTU has established a policy
          to share the revenue derived from IP monetization among various
          stakeholders. In addition to DTU, these stakeholders include
          inventors, affiliated academic entities of DTU, and administrative
          entities engaged in IP management and commercialization. DTU retains
          the authority to determine the respective shares allocated to
          different stakeholders involved in the creation and dissemination of
          IP, and such allocations may be periodically reviewed and adjusted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, the revenue share allocated to the inventor(s) is designed to
          persist even after their association with DTU concludes. The
          administering entity will develop procedures to facilitate this
          continued revenue sharing, ensuring a fair and sustained mechanism for
          recognizing the contributions of inventors in the ongoing success of
          IP monetization.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- Heading 11 -->
        <h3>11. Noncompliance and conflict of Interest</h3>
        <p>
          Every inventor at DTU bears the responsibility for adhering to
          government regulations, as well as the policies and ordinances set
          forth by DTU, concerning the development and utilization of
          intellectual property (IP). In the course of implementing the IP
          policy of the Institute, all faculty members and inventors are
          obligated to steer clear of potential and mutual conflicts of
          interest.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- Heading 12 -->
        <h3>12. Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of any disputes arising in connection with the
          implementation of intellectual property rights (IPR), the designated
          jurisdiction shall be limited to Delhi.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- Heading 13 -->
        <h3>13. Noncompliance and conflict of Interest</h3>
        <p>
          In case of any unforeseen requirements, the direction/decision of
          Hon’ble Vice Chancellor shall be final and binding. The policy will be
          reviewed as and when required.
