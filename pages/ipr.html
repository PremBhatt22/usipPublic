      <h3>1. Preamble</h3>
      <p>
        Delhi Technological University (hereafter remarked as 'DTU') is a
        University that continuously strives to attain academic excellence in
        teaching and research in the domain of Science, Engineering, Technology,
        Economics and Management. Its actions and pursuits are targeted upon
        faculty/students/project staff/supporting staff/visitors and are based
        on knowledge and conversance. As twenty first century is known to be
        administered by technological advancements, where values and
        perspicacity change in the blink of an eye, the system demands the
        technological institutions to preserve the primary sense of academics &
        research on one hand and on the other side, accept the dynamic horizons
        of entrepreneurship and business economy on the grounds of knowledge
        generated, protected and distributed under the intellectual property
        Regime. Because the world these days is incredibly dynamic and there's
        an increasing awareness of the 'knowledge asset', an intellectual
        property Rights (IPR) Policy is needed not only to protect the concerns
        of DTU but additionally to make DTU faculty/students/supporting
        staff/project staff/ visitors alert regarding 'knowledge asset and its
        impact on the society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The present policy ensures the protection of the claims of the
        Inventor(s) of DTU Le. faculty/students/supporting staff/ project staff/
        visitors of DTU through the choice of intellectual property protection
        on a completely unique work, ideas, inventions, products, technology or
        to keep it open for public domain, whichever they find appropriate. In
        accordance with the Mission and Vision of DTU, the policy stands with
        the outreach of the innovative technologies developed at DTU. The policy
        also motivates the Researchers, Faculty and Students of DTU to induct
        technology sharing using the intellectual property Rights gained over a
        completely unique technology.
      </p>

        Section 2 - Ownership Of Intellectual Property
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h3>2.1 Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Excellence in research and education, exchange and dissemination of
        knowledge are guiding principles of DTU. These activities may lead to
        the generation of new Intellectual Property (IP), which needs to be
        protected, developed, transferred, and commercialized for the benefit of
        society. Also, the information on the newly created and protected IP
        should be disseminated at the earliest so that the scientific community
        is not deprived of its right to knowledge and can carry out further
        research. This can be facilitated only if the Ownership of a newly
        created IP is clearly defined. Clarity on Ownership of IP protects the
        interest of both the inventor(s) and society at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like in the case of other types of property where there is an owner who
        can sell, rent, and gift the property, the same concept is applicable in
        respect of all IPs. An owner of an IP is the one who has the rights to
        enter into the transaction of IP such as licensing, selling, assigning
        of IPR, or engaging in any other similar activity, to earn revenue or
        any consideration accruing from such an activity and retain, share and
        utilize the revenue so earned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Owning an IP involves a process defined by law and has costs associated
        with it. Each country has its own legal status and fee structure. An
        owner needs to acquire ownership rights separately in each country by
        paying the necessary registration fee and associated expenses. Retaining
        the ownership involves payment of maintenance fees as per the prescribed
        laws over the life of the IP.

      <h3>2.2 Types of Activities Leading to Generation of IP</h3>
      <p>
        DTU has engaged itself in different types of Research and Development
        (R&D) activities, including the following, which may generate
        intellectual property(ies):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Research taken up by a faculty/student/project staff/supporting
          staff/visitor in the normal course of his/her appointment/engagement
          at DTU with funds coming from DTU (this would include research
          projects undertaken by students under the supervision of the faculty
          member).
        </li>
        <li>
          Research taken up by a faculty/student/project staff/supporting
          staff/visitor from funds coming from a sponsor such as Government of
          India, state governments, international agencies, or foreign
          governments, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborative research undertaken with other institutions including
          government departments and agencies, PSUs, and private companies
          located in India.
        </li>
        <li>
          International collaborative research with institutions and companies
          located outside India.
        </li>
        <li>
          Research supported by companies and other private organizations
          through research projects or consultancy assignments.
        </li>
        <li>Any combination(s) of the above.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Ownership of IP in the above-mentioned situations may not be
        defined/specified in the same way. The ownership definitions for
        different types of IP and other relevant aspects are described in
        Section 2.3.
      </p>

          It has been developed either solely with the use of funds/facilities
          provided by DTU or with a mix of funds/facilities of DTU and external
          agencies but without any formal associated agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          It has been developed with the use of external funds/facilities,
          including that of sponsored research and consultancy projects without
          any associated agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          It has been developed under any contract arrangement including "work
          for hire," work commissioned, and/or outsourced by DTU.
        </li>
        <li>
          It has been developed pursuant to a written agreement where ownership
          has been transferred to DTU. Examples are work assigned to
          programmers, writers of DTU publications, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is not assignable to an individual or a specific group of
          identifiable contributors, i.e., software or technology or process
          developed over a period of time with contributions from different
          individuals of/for DTU.

      <p>
        For sharing of IP in case of sponsored research and consultancy projects
        or any other collaborative activity, the following guidelines shall be
        followed:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the funding agency allows DTU to own the IP, then DTU may share its
          rights with other Third party(ies) subject to their respective
          contributions.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of funds provided by an agency of the Government of India, the
          ownership shall be decided in compliance with the ownership clauses
          defined by the funding agency at the time of approval of the
          activity(ies).
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of funds provided by a non-government agency, the ownership
          may be shared between DTU and the funding agency. The sharing may take
          into consideration the relative contributions of the parties involved
          as well as any background IP with respective parties. Waiver of joint
          ownership can be considered by DTU on recommendation(s) of the
          involved inventor(s) or Lead Inventor based on the adequacy of
          compensation provided to DTU.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a multi-country/multi-institutional collaborative project, there
          must be an explicit agreement defining the ownership of IP generated.
          (Normally, IP will be shared among only those parties that contribute
          towards the creation of IP through the direct involvement of their
          human/other resources.)
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of collaborative activity with foreign institutions involving
          indigenous biological material, IP ownership has to take into account
          restrictions as per the prevailing 'Biological Diversity Act 2002' of
          India.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong
          >(C) The Intellectual property can be owned by the Inventor(s)
          if:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        None of the situations defined above for DTU or Third-party ownership
        applies, and the IP is unrelated to the inventor's engagement with DTU.
        For faculty and staff, the engagement implies responsibilities
        associated with employment. It is also expected that the person
        concerned would have pursued these activities outside of normal working
        hours of DTU.

      <h5>2.3.2 Copyright Other Than Software</h5>

      <p><strong>(A) Copyright Owned by the Author(s):</strong></p>
      <p>
        The copyrights are owned by the authors for textbooks, research books,
        articles, monographs, teaching-learning resource materials, and other
        scholarly publications unless restricted by an associated agreement.
        These may also include popular novels, poems, musical compositions,
        other works of artistic imagination, etc. It is advisable to keep DTU
        informed about such creations. Revenue generated, if any, from such
        activities must be reported to DTU as per the prevailing rules of income
        from other professional activities/sources.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(B) Copyright Owned by DTU:</strong></p>
      <p>
        The copyright is owned by DTU if the work is created under any contract
        (same as described under Clause A of Section 2.3.1).
      </p>

      <p><strong>(C) Copyright Reassignable to Authors:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Copyright works that are normally assignable to DTU may be reassigned to
        the author on request of the author provided it does not violate any
        agreement with a third party and does not intervene/harm the interests
        of DTU.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(D) Copyright Owned by Student:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Copyrights of theses, dissertations, term papers, laboratory records,
          and other documents produced by a student during the course of his/her
          study will reside with the student unless restricted by an associated
          agreement and/or research carried out using facilities that have come
          to DTU with pre-imposed IP protection restrictions.
        </li>
        <li>
          For claiming ownership of copyright for theses and dissertations, the
          student(s) has/have to declare that the thesis does not include any
          information that needs IP protection by DTU.
        </li>
        <li>
          Further, any IP generated (other than copyright) out of the work
          carried out by the student would be covered as per Clause (A) and
          Clause (B) of Section 2.3.1.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any such work could not be protected before submission of the
          thesis, concerned inventors should take steps to protect the IP within
          a period of six months of submission of the thesis. DTU would have a
          mechanism in place for processing such theses in order to protect the
          confidential information during this period.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>(E) Open Access Policy:</strong></p>
      <p>As per Annexure-III.</p>

      <h5>2.3.3 Trade and Service Marks</h5>
      <p>
        Trade and service marks related to goods and services involving DTU will
        be owned by DTU. Use of DTU's name through trademarks makes users
        obligated to certain standards and accountability described later in
        Section 3.7.
      </p>

      <h5>2.3.4 Protection of Biodiversity and Traditional Knowledge</h5>
      <p>
        DTU affirms that it abides by the national laws on biodiversity and
        traditional knowledge. Inventor(s) have to ensure that the provisions
        under the national laws on biodiversity and traditional knowledge are
        not violated during the course of securing any IP protection or use of
        such knowledge.
      </p>

      <h5>2.3.5 Waiver of IP Rights by DTU</h5>
      <p>
        Subject to any associated agreement and with appropriate approval from
        the sponsor, DTU may waive its rights to specified intellectual property
        in favor of the inventor to enable the inventor to seek funding or other
        support for the purpose of commercialization, or if the Institute's
        assessment doesn't favor IP protection. Such waiver of ownership in
        favor of the inventor(s) can be considered:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If DTU decides not to pursue the protection of IP within a period of
          six months of complete disclosure by the inventor to DTU. The decision
          to pursue or not to pursue should be communicated to the inventor
          within a period of three months of complete disclosure by the inventor
          to DTU, or
        </li>
        <li>
          If it is established that such ownership of the inventor would be
          essential to enable dissemination of the benefits of the invention to
          society.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In all cases, unless explicitly agreed to, DTU shall normally retain a
        perpetual, royalty-free license to use the intellectual property and any
        corresponding IP for research and educational purposes.
      </p>

      <h5>2.3.6 Trade Secrets and Know-How Information</h5>
      <p>
        Trade secrets and know-how fall outside the scope of protection under
        the current IP regime of India. It is important for the owner of such
        secrets and know-how to maintain confidentiality through confidentiality
        or non-disclosure agreements (NDA) with other parties. To protect the
        information exchanged or being exchanged with third parties associated
        with an activity, the lead inventor/faculty is encouraged to sign
        separate NDAs with third parties, associated faculty members, students,
        supporting staff, project staff, and visitors. Such confidential
        information should not be incorporated in a student's thesis without the
        written permission of the owner of the information. Trade secrets and
        know-how information should be exchanged with third parties in writing
        through a disclosure notice to keep a record of the time and extent of
        disclosure. Such NDAs should have a reasonable time limit from the date
        of disclosure of the information by the two parties to avoid hampering
        dissemination and propagation of scientific information to society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considerable amounts of IP generated at DTU result from students'
        work/theses intended for research publication. In view of this, it is
        important that NDAs with third parties include clauses specifying a time
        limit for assessing IP created and filing IP under an activity. At any
        time, several faculty members, students, supporting staff, and project
        staff may be working on different aspects of the same research area.
        NDAs or any other agreements of collaboration must protect research and
        development interests and activities of DTU by persons unrelated to the
        agreement and avoid any restrictive clauses in this regard, even for a
        limited period.
      </p>

      <h5>2.3.7 Copyrights Owned by Third Parties</h5>

      <p><strong>(a) Software</strong></p>
      <p>
        DTU expects that its faculty, students, project staff, supporting staff,
        and visitors understand the obligations made to third parties related to
        software and databases. It is possible that DTU faculty, students,
        staff, project staff, and visitors are engaged in developing software or
        other IP using software, which are not in the public domain and are
        proprietary to certain suppliers. It is usual for DTU to procure such
        software for education and research purposes. Many such licenses may
        have restrictions on IP creation and/or its commercial use. It is
        important that if there are any restrictions in the software employed
        for such IP creation, the same are settled with the owner/supplier of
        the software before initiating IP protection. Software of general use
        shall be procured with a valid license.
      </p>

      <p><strong>(b) Other Copyrighted Material</strong></p>
      <p>
        DTU and its faculty, students, supporting staff, project staff, and
        visitors:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Would use copyrighted materials for only personal use, teaching, and
          research purposes as permitted by Indian law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Will respect the protection offered by Indian copyright law to all
          copyrighted material.
        </li>
        <li>
          Would not use copyrighted material in their theses, publications,
          reports, and other professional documents without taking explicit
          prior permission from the copyright holder.

        Section 3 - TRANSFER AND USE OF IP
      </h2>
      <br />
      <h3>1 INTRODUCTION</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of transfer and use of IP by DTU, which is a non-profit
        academic organization, is to meet one of its stated objectives of
        disseminating the fruits of research and development for the benefit of
        society. DTU recognizes that translation of created IP to products and
        services of benefit to society is a complex process that normally
        involves considerable risk taking and expenses. The DTU policy on
        transfer and use of IP proposed here takes into account the above fact.
        Further, commercialization provides incentive to the inventor(s) and
        provides 'technology push' to the invention and couples it to the
        'market pull'. Commercialization of IP is generally carried out via
        licensing or assignment. A licensing agreement is a partnership between
        an intellectual property rights owner (licensor) and another who is
        authorized to use such rights (licensee) in exchange for an agreed
        payment (fee or royalty) whereas assignment of IP involves transfer of
        ownership irrevocably and permanently to the assignee by the assignor
        (www.wipo.int). Also, proprietary know-how generated by DTU is a known
        form of IP, and its transfer and use is covered by this policy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>2 MATERIAL TRANSFER AGREEMENT (MTA)</h3>
      <p>
        In case NOA does not cover material transfer clause, an appropriate MTA
        such as in the case of biotechnology inventions shall be signed between
        the donor and the recipient of the material regarding the use of the
        subject material.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        3 POLICY RELATED TO TRANSFER OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCE AND ASSOCIATED
        KNOWLEDGE
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Biological Diversity Act 2002 of India regulates the access to
        Biological resources of the country by non-citizens, non-residents of
        the country as well as a body corporate, association or organization not
        incorporated or registered in India. The Act prohibits such
        persons/entities from obtaining any biological resource occurring in
        India or knowledge associated there to for research or for commercial
        utilization or for bio-safety and bio-utilization. The Act prevents any
        person from transferring the results of any research for financial
        consideration or otherwise to such persons/entities without prior
        approval of the National Biodiversity authority (NBA).
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>4 POLICY FOR IP LICENSING AND ASSIGNMENT</h3>
      <p>
        Licensing intellectual property to a third party is the most common
        modality for technology transfer leading towards commercialization.
        There are various modes of licensing strategy including the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Exclusive licensing: The licensor licenses the IP only to one
          licensee. In other words the licensee is the only one authorized by
          the licensor to use and exploit the IP. Even the licensor is excluded
          from using and exploiting the IP.
        </li>
        <li>
          Non-exclusive licensing: In this type of licensing, the licensor is
          permitted to enter into agreements with more than one entity for use
          and exploitation of the IP. In other words, the same IP may be used by
          many licensees at the same time for the same purpose or for different
          purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sole licensing: In this case also, the licensor licenses to only one
          licensee. However, under this licensing, the licensor can also use and
          exploit the IP.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sub-licensing: Sub-licensing is applicable when a licensee wishes to
          further license the IP to another party(ies).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Given the breadth of research and development taking place at DTU and
        diversity of the IP so created, each license agreement is somewhat
        unique to the technology being transferred. The following guidelines are
        applicable to license agreement with a Third party:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Generally no entity shall be granted exclusive right for the
          development/commercialization of intellectual property owned by DTU.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sub-licensing must be specified whether it is permitted or not, and
          even if permitted, whether the consent of the licensor is required or
          not should be clearly stated in the license agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          If an entity is granted exclusive rights with respect to a particular
          IP, the same should be for a limited period to obviate the possibility
          of misuse/no-use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wherever applicable, it should be ensured that the licensing process
          does not restrict the research/publication rights as well as
          incorporation of necessary material in the thesis of the associated
          student inventor(s).
        </li>
        <li>
          DTU and its inventors should be protected and indemnified from all
          liability arising from development and commercialization of a
          particular intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li>
          Will not place restriction(s) beyond the inventor(s) on DTU from
          entering into research and development in the same area independently
          or with other organization(s).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The license agreement may contain such other provisions as may be
        determined by DTU in the best interest of the society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assignment of IP by DTU to another party may be carried out under the
        circumstances such as conditions by the government or its agencies,
        defense purposes or if the IP created distinctly accrues benefits to the
        society at large.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        5 POLICY FOR IP LICENSING AND ASSIGNING FOR START-UP VENTURES WITH
        INVOLVEMENT OF INVENTOR(S) FROM DTU
      </h3>
      <p>
        In order to encourage commercialization of IP registered and owned by
        DTU, inventor(s) of such IPs shall be encouraged to promote a start-up
        company (following the guidelines established by DTU) for developing a
        business proposition leveraging the IP under consideration. For this
        purpose, the start-up can also be accommodated at the DTU IIF at DTU, if
        so desired by the Inventor(s), after critical appraisal of the Business
        Plan as per applicable procedures of DTU.
      </p>
      <p>
        The start-ups in the specified instances shall be licensed IPs owned by
        DTU on a limited exclusivity basis initially for a period of 3 years.
        The licensing fee may be decided depending on the nature of funding
        available for such a venture including the possibility of making the
        know-how/technology available even without any license fee. However, all
        such licensing should be accompanied by an appropriate agreement and a
        monitoring mechanism. During the limited exclusivity period, the
        start-up shall have 'no rights to sub-license' to any Third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the start-up venture establishes the commercial viability within
        the limited exclusivity period, the license agreement shall be
        re-visited and modified into exclusive over an extended period with a
        royalty consideration, the quantum of which shall be determined by DTU.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case the start-up fails to achieve commercial breakthrough within the
        allotted period, the exclusivity of the license to the start-up shall be
        forfeited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, as any entity set-up under the DTU IIF is an independent
        commercial entity, DTU would not have any rights to IP/Know-how
        developed within the entity unless covered by an explicit agreement.
      </p>

      <h3>6 SHARING OF REVENUE BETWEEN DTU AND INVENTOR(S)</h3>
      <p>
        The sub-section refers to revenue generated from monetization of IP.
        Protection of IP among other things is meant to provide incentive to all
        those associated with DTU with a potential for pursuing research leading
        to marketable product or processes and as a consequence generate revenue
        for DTU. Therefore, it is the policy of DTU to share the revenue from
        monetization of IP among stakeholders. These stakeholders besides DTU
        will include inventors, associated academic entities of DTU and the
        administrative entities engaged in IP management and commercialization.
      </p>
      <p>
        DTU reserves the right to determine the share of the different
        stakeholders involved in IP creation and dissemination from time to
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Revenue share of the inventor(s) shall continue even after their
        association with DTU ends. The administering entity would evolve
        procedure to enable this sharing.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        7 POLICY RELATED TO THE USE OF NAME OF DTU AND TRADEMARKS OWNED BY DTU
        BY THIRD PARTIES
      </h3>
      <p>
        DTU would allow the use of its name and trademarks owned by it to the
        Third party(ies) to whom IP has been licensed/assigned through a signed
        agreement on following conditions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>IP is intended to be used for the benefit of society.</li>
        <li>
          IP is licensed/assigned with an undertaking from the licensee/assignee
          that IP will be used-
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a responsible manner to create a product/process conforming to
              environmental safety, and good manufacturing practices promoted by
              the Government of India and its regulatory bodies.
            </li>
            <li>
              In promoting truthful claims and information, i.e. not for
              misleading the society or users.
            </li>
            <li>
              Without any liability to DTU in case of misuse of IP or accidental
              damage accruing due to use of IP.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>In no case IP will be used against the interest of India.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In all such cases, the licensee/assignee must take prior approval of DTU
        about the manner in which the name of DTU and its trademarks are to be
        used in any media including print and electronic media.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>8 NONCOMPLIANCE AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST</h3>
      <p>
        All inventors are responsible for compliance with government rules and
        DTU's policies and ordinances related to development and use of IP
        generated. In all activities arising out of implementation of IPR policy
        of the Institute, all faculty members/inventors are expected to avoid
        potential and mutual conflicts of interest.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>9 JURISDICTION</h3>
      <p>
        For any dispute arising related to IPR implementation, the jurisdiction
        will be Delhi only.
